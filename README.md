# Project Skeleton

This repository demonstrates a simple multi-platform project layout. It contains a Python FastAPI backend and placeholders for separate mobile and web frontends. Folders for infrastructure scripts and documentation are included as well.

## Directory Structure

- `backend/` – FastAPI application code
- `frontend/mobile/` – placeholder for mobile client
- `frontend/web/` – web client implementation
- `infra/` – infrastructure configuration
- `docs/` – project documentation

This structure provides a starting point for expanding the backend and frontend implementations or adding deployment scripts under `infra`.
